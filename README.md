# Delivery #1

## Final Delivery Java Development

This project is a console-based Library Management System implemented in Java. It's designed to help librarians and staff manage a library's collection of books, track registered patrons, and handle book borrowing and returns. The system emphasizes object-oriented programming principles, data structures, and basic algorithm design.

## Features

*   **Book Management:** Add, remove, display, edit, and search books (by title, author, ISBN).
*   **Patron Management:** Register, display, edit, search patrons, and view books per patron.
*   **Borrowing/Returning:**  Borrow and return books (requires ISBN and Patron ID).
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Text-based menu with input validation.

## How to Run

1.  **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/seradotcom/library-management`
2.  **Compile:** `javac Library.java Book.java Patron.java Main.java`
3.  **Run:**
    *   Interactive: `java Main`
    *   With input/output files (Windows PowerShell): `Get-Content input.txt | java Main > output.txt`
    *    With input/output files (Windows CMD): `cmd /c "java Main < input.txt > output.txt"`
    *   With input/output files (Linux/macOS): `java Main < input.txt > output.txt`
4.  Follow the on-screen menu.

## Project Structure

*   **`Library.java`:** Core logic for managing books and patrons.
*   **`Book.java`:** Represents a book.
*   **`Patron.java`:** Represents a patron.
*   **`Main.java`:** User interface and program entry point.
